# Kana Match
Kana Match is a simple game where you flip over two random cards at a time, trying to find a match. (In this version, you're matching Hiragana or Katakana to their JP equivalent.) 

## Technologies / Topics Covered
The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and focusus on the following topics:
- Dom Manipulation
- localStorage
- eventListeners
- Animations

In addition to the basic rules of a match two game, I added the ability to choose between two different data sets as well as a difficulty setting that increases the number of cards per round.

## UI
Kana Match uses responsive design and takes a mobile first approach.
